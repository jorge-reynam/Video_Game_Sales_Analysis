# Video Game Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical video game sales data to identify trends across platforms, genres, and regions. The goal is to uncover patterns that can support **data-driven decision-making** in the gaming industry, particularly in marketing and product strategy.


## Objectives
- Analyze the lifecycle of gaming platforms  
- Identify top-performing platforms and genres  
- Evaluate regional differences in sales  
- Explore the relationship between user reviews and sales  
- Validate statistical hypotheses about user ratings  


## Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- Game titles  
- Platforms (e.g., PS2, Xbox, PC)  
- Release years  
- Sales (global and regional)  
- User and critic scores  
- Genres  


## Methodology
The analysis was carried out in the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Standardizing column names  
   - Filtering relevant time periods  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Platform lifecycle analysis  
   - Sales distribution using boxplots  
   - Identification of top-selling games and genres  

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Correlation analysis (sales vs user reviews)  
   - Hypothesis testing for:
     - Platform ratings (Xbox One vs PC)  
     - Genre ratings (Action vs Sports)  

4. **Regional Analysis**
   - Comparison of platform and genre performance across regions  


## Key Visualizations

### Platform Trends
- Older platforms (pre-2000) tend to have longer life cycles.  
- Modern platforms show shorter but more dynamic market presence.  

### Top Platforms
- Leading platforms: **PS2, X360, PS3, Wii, GBA, PS4, PSP, 3DS, XB, GC**  
- **PS3, Wii, and X360** showed strong growth and profitability potential (2000–2011).  

### Sales Distribution
- Sales are unevenly distributed across platforms.  
- A few games generate extremely high sales (**outliers**), while most remain average.  

### Sales vs Reviews
- Weak correlation between **user reviews and sales**.  
- Sales cannot be reliably predicted based on ratings alone.  

### Platform-Specific Performance
- Game success varies significantly by platform.  
- Example: *007: Quantum of Solace* performs differently depending on the platform.  

### Top Genres
- Highest-selling genres:
  - Action  
  - Sports  
  - Shooter
  

## Regional Insights
- Platform and genre popularity vary across regions.  
- Some platforms dominate specific markets but not others.  
- Differences likely driven by **availability and user preferences**.

## Hypothesis Testing

- H0: User ratings for **Xbox One vs PC** are **not statistically equal**  
- H1: User ratings for **Action vs Sports genres** are **statistically similar**  


## Business Recommendations
- Use **regional insights** to design targeted marketing campaigns  
- Focus on **top-performing genres and platforms per region**  
- Avoid relying solely on **user ratings** for sales predictions  
- Prioritize platforms with **sustained growth trends**  


## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib / Seaborn)  
- Statistical Testing  
- Business Insight Generation  

## Future Work
- Build predictive models for sales forecasting  
- Incorporate critic reviews and external factors  
- Analyze trends for newer platforms (post-2015)
